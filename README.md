This is the UCSB Robolab's (well ok right now just Sean's) collection of OpenAI gym environments. 

To use the easiest way is to clone or download the repo. Then use:

pip install -e ./gym_ucsb_robolab

The e installs the package in editing mode, so any changes you make will be updated whenever you reload the package.
